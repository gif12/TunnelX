# TunnelX

TunnelX is a free and open-source Windows split-tunneling client built by **MaxFan**. It routes selected apps, selected destinations, or the whole system through supported tunnel cores while keeping local and excluded destinations on the normal network path.

> Status: pre-release. Review `docs/PUBLISHING_CHECKLIST.md` before publishing a public repository or release artifact.

## Features

- App-based split tunneling for selected Windows processes
- Full-route mode for whole-system tunneling
- Xray-core / sing-box based V2Ray workflows
- Local SOCKS5 proxy for tools that need `127.0.0.1`
- DNS redirect, IPv6 blocking, leak guard, route diagnostics, and traffic history
- Persian-first Windows desktop UI

## Download

Public downloads should be attached to GitHub Releases after the checklist is complete:

## Build

Requirements:

- Windows 10/11
- 64-bit Windows (`win-x64`). 32-bit Windows is not supported by the current release package.
- .NET 8 SDK
- Administrator privileges when running the app, because route and packet interception features need elevated access

dotnet build AppTunnel.sln -c Release
