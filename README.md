# TunnelX

[فارسی](README.fa.md) | English

TunnelX is a free and open-source Windows split-tunneling client built by **MaxFan**. It routes selected apps, selected destinations, or the whole system through supported tunnel cores while keeping local and excluded destinations on the normal network path.

## Features

- App-based split tunneling for selected Windows processes
- Full-route mode for whole-system tunneling
- Xray-core / sing-box based V2Ray workflows
- OpenVPN Community support via user-provided `.ovpn` files for app-based split tunneling
- Local SOCKS5 proxy for tools that need `127.0.0.1`
- DNS redirect, IPv6 blocking, leak guard, route diagnostics, and traffic history
- Persian-first Windows desktop UI

## OpenVPN

TunnelX can run an installed **OpenVPN Community** `openvpn.exe` with a user-selected `.ovpn` profile, then apply its own split-tunneling policy so only selected apps and included destinations use the OpenVPN tunnel.

OpenVPN is not bundled with TunnelX. Install OpenVPN Community separately, select the `.ovpn` file in TunnelX, and enter the OpenVPN username/password if the server requires credentials. OpenVPN Connect alone is not enough for this mode because it manages routes and DNS through its own client.

## Download

Public downloads should be attached to GitHub Releases after release validation is complete:

[GitHub project](https://github.com/MaxiFan/TunnelX)

Release assets are built and uploaded by GitHub Actions. Each published standalone executable includes a `.sha256` checksum file, and the release notes link back to the workflow run that produced the artifact.

## Build

End-user requirements for the recommended standalone release:

- Windows 10/11
- 64-bit Windows (`win-x64`). 32-bit Windows is not supported by the current release package.
- Administrator privileges when running the app, because route and packet interception features need elevated access
- No separate .NET Runtime installation is required for the self-contained standalone EXE.

Developer requirements for building from source:

- .NET 8 SDK

```powershell
dotnet build AppTunnel.sln -c Release
dotnet publish AppTunnel\AppTunnel.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -p:DebugType=None -p:DebugSymbols=false
```

More release notes are in `docs/BUILD.md`. Future ideas are tracked in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
