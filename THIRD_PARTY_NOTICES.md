# Third-Party Notices

TunnelX includes or works with third-party software. These notices are part of the release package and should be reviewed before publishing binaries.

## Optional Online Services (while connected)

When the user is connected, TunnelX may call the hosts below **through the local tunnel proxy** for exit-IP display, country lookup, or flag images. These are not bundled binaries; terms and privacy policies belong to each provider.

| Host | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ipv4.icanhazip.com`, `api.ipify.org`, `ifconfig.me` | Public exit IP detection |
| `ip-api.com`, `ipwho.is`, `ipapi.co` | Country / region lookup |
| `flagcdn.com` | Country flag PNG images |
| `api.github.com`, `github.com` | Release update checks |

See `docs/PRIVACY.md` for how these requests are routed.

## Redistributing Binaries

- Keep this file with every binary release.
- Keep `AppTunnel/NativeLibs/LICENSE` with WinDivert notices.
- The current repository bundles x64 native components only. Do not advertise 32-bit Windows support unless separate x86 binaries and tests are added.
- Do not remove upstream copyright or license notices.
- Keep the Vazirmatn SIL Open Font License notice when redistributing builds that embed the font.
- If native binaries are updated, refresh this table and the release checklist.
- If crypto, GeoIP, GeoSite, or core binaries are downloaded from upstream releases, record the exact version and source URL in the release notes.
- WireGuard protocol support is provided through the bundled sing-box executable and its WireGuard endpoint support. If future builds switch to official WireGuard/WireGuardNT/Wintun components directly, refresh the notices and redistribution checklist before publishing.
