# Privacy

TunnelX is designed as a local desktop app.

## Data Stored Locally

The app may store profiles, selected apps, include/exclude destinations, connection history, and logs on the user's Windows machine, typically under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TunnelX` or the app directory depending on the feature.

## Network Data

TunnelX handles local routing and packet metadata to decide what should use the tunnel. It does not intentionally send analytics or telemetry to the maintainer.

## Exit IP and Country Display (while connected)

When the connected dashboard shows your public exit IP, optional country name, or flag image, TunnelX performs on-demand HTTPS requests **through the local SOCKS/mixed proxy** so traffic exits via the active tunnel (not as a separate direct lookup from your normal network path).

| Purpose | Third-party hosts | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public exit IP | `ipv4.icanhazip.com`, `api.ipify.org`, `ifconfig.me` | Fallback chain; retries while connected |
| Country / region lookup | `ip-api.com`, `ipwho.is`, `ipapi.co` | Tried in order until one succeeds |
| Flag image (PNG) | `flagcdn.com` | Path pattern `/h20/{country-code}.png` |

These services receive requests that appear to come from your tunnel exit IP. They are not used for maintainer-side tracking. If you disconnect, these lookups stop for that session.

## Update Checks

Scheduled or manual update checks contact **GitHub Releases** (`api.github.com` / `github.com`) to compare the installed version with the latest published release. Release notes may be shown in-app from the same source.

## Logs

Logs can contain hostnames, IP addresses, process names, ports, and connection state. Users should sanitize logs before posting them publicly.

## Donations

Donation links open external services such as PayPal. Those services have their own privacy policies.

Crypto wallet addresses are public receiving addresses. On-chain transactions may be publicly visible and can connect the project identity with wallet activity. For stronger maintainer privacy, use wallets created specifically for TunnelX.
